/**
 * <p>
 * <b>This is a recode for J2ME of the <i>public class java.util.Observable</i>.</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class represents an observable object, or "data" in the model-view
 * paradigm. It can be subclassed to represent an object that the application
 * wants to have observed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An observable object can have one or more observers. An observer may be any
 * object that implements interface Observer. After an observable instance
 * changes, an application calling the Observable's notifyObservers method
 * causes all of its observers to be notified of the change by a call to their
 * update method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The order in which notifications will be delivered is unspecified. The
 * default implementation provided in the Observable class will notify Observers
 * in the order in which they registered interest, but subclasses may change
 * this order, use no guaranteed order, deliver notifications on separate
 * threads, or may guarantee that their subclass follows this order, as they
 * choose.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that this notification mechanism is has nothing to do with threads and
 * is completely separate from the wait and notify mechanism of class Object.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When an observable object is newly created, its set of observers is empty.
 * Two observers are considered the same if and only if the equals method
 * returns true for them.
 * </p>
