# You can also define localized preprocessing variables here, by starting the 
# definition with "var:". Variables defined here will override the ones defined
# in the <variables>-section of your build.xml.
# Variables starting with "polish." or "MIDlet-" don't need to start with "var:"
# by the way.
#var:MyExampleVariable=Hallo Welt
#var:GameName=Beispiel


# It's also possible to set MIDlet-attributes for your JAD- and MANIFEST-files here. 
# If you like you can start them with "var:" as well, but it is not needed.
# Again MIDlet-attributes defined override the one defined in the <info>-
# and <jad>-sections of your build.xml
#MIDlet-Description=Eine Beispielsanwendung.
#MIDlet-Name=J2ME Polish Beispiel
#MIDlet-Delete-Confirm=J2ME Polish wirklich l\u00f6schen?
